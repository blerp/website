                    counter-notice as set forth below. If we determine that any
                    user has repeatedly infringed upon the intellectual property
                    rights of others, we will disable any accounts that user has

                    removed; 3. A statement that the user has a good faith

                    to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial
                    district in which the user's address is located, or if the
                    user's address is located outside the United States, for any
                    judicial district in which Company is located, and that such
                    person or entity will accept service of process from the
                    person who provided notification of the alleged
                    infringement.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    legal action relating to the allegedly infringing material
                    before that period passes, Company will consider restoring

                    <br />
                    3. Registration. While general use of the Site does not
                    require you to have an account, to use some aspects of the
                    Services, you must register for an account (an "Account").
                    You must provide accurate and complete information and keep
                    your Account information updated. Should we require that you
                    select a username, you shall not: (i) select or use as a
                    username a name of another person with the intent to
                    impersonate that person; (ii) use as a username a name
                    subject to any rights of any third party without appropriate
                    authorization; or (iii) use, as a username, a name that is
                    otherwise offensive, vulgar, obscene, or that we deem
                    objectionable in our sole discretion. Without limiting the
                    foregoing, we reserve the right to require that any user
                    change its username at any time, for any reason. You are
                    solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your
                    Account, and for keeping your Account password secure. You
                    may never use another person's user account or registration
                    information for the Services without permission. You must
                    notify us immediately of any change in your eligibility to
                    use the Services (including any changes to or revocation of
                    any licenses from state authorities), breach of security or
                    unauthorized use of your Account. You should never publish,
                    distribute or post login information for your Account. You
                    shall have the ability to delete your Account, either
                    directly or through a request made to one of our employees
                    or affiliates.

                    graphics, and interactive features generated, provided, or
                    otherwise made accessible on or through the Services. For
                    the purposes of this Agreement, "Content" also includes all

                    distributed, posted to, or created using the Services by
                    users (collectively "User Content"), whether publicly posted
                    or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the
                    person who originated such User Content. You represent that

                    up-to-date, and in compliance with all applicable laws,
                    rules and regulations. Without limiting the generality of
                    the foregoing, you represent that any User Content you
                    create using tools accessible on the Services does not
                    infringe upon the intellectual property rights of any third

                    laws, rules and regulations. You acknowledge that all
                    Content, including User Content, accessed by you using the
                    Services is at your own risk and you will be solely
                    responsible for any damage or loss to you or any other party
                    resulting therefrom. We do not guarantee that any Content
                    you access on or through the Services is or will continue to
                    be accurate.

                    Service, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive,
                    non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable,
                    revocable, worldwide, limited, royalty-free right and
                    license to access and use our API solely to allow for the
                    creation of software applications that interface with the
                    Services (collectively, the "Applications"). We reserve the
                    right to deny and/or revoke access to the API for any reason
                    or no reason, at any time, without notice. Subject to these
                    Terms of Service, we hereby grant you a non-exclusive,
                    non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable,
                    revocable, worldwide, limited, right and license to use,
                    reproduce, display, and distribute the Blerp trademarks and
                    service marks (the "Blerp Marks") solely in connection with
                    your licensed and authorized use of the API. You may not use
                    the Blerp Marks in the titles or logos of Applications or
                    other products or services, or in any way that implies our
                    endorsement or sponsorship, or false association with such
                    Applications. You shall (i) conspicuously label any
                    Application with the words "Powered by Blerp," and the Blerp
                    logo, and (ii) comply with the branding requirements that we
                    may provide to you from time to time. For example, you agree
                    not to use the name or logo "Blurp," "Bleerp," or "Blerpy",
                    or any similar names or logos, in your Application. You
                    acknowledge and agree that any and all goodwill accruing
                    from the use of the Blerp shall inure solely to our benefit
                    and that, other than the limited license granted herein, you
                    have no right, title, or interest in any of the Blerp Marks.
                    You shall not use Content to create a database, directory,
                    or index containing GIFs or to improve, edit, augment or
                    supplement any existing database, directory, or index
                    containing GIFs. In addition, you shall not commingle Blerp
                    search results with search results of another provider
                    without Blerp's express written approval.

                    b) API Limitations. You agree to respect the programmatic
                    limitations of our API and the restrictions of these Terms
                    of Service in designing and implementing Applications. In
                    addition, you shall comply with any limitations on the
                    frequency of access, calls and use of the API as provided to
                    you by us from time to time. We expressly reserve the right
                    in our sole discretion to limit the number and/or frequency
                    of the API requests. You acknowledge that we may change or
                    republish the API at any time and that it is your obligation
                    to ensure that calls or requests you make through the
                    Application are compatible with the then-current API. We may
                    attempt to inform you of any changes with reasonable notice
                    so you can adjust your service but are under no obligation
                    to do so.

                    <br />

                    functionality, origin, capabilities, or other aspects of an
                    Application, including through an Application description.
                    You shall make sure that your users understand that
                    Applications are not official applications of ours or
                    endorsed by us in any way.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    d) Application Support. You are solely responsible for any
                    Applications that make use of the Services and for providing
                    all support and technical assistance to end users of the
                    Applications. You acknowledge and agree that we have no
                    obligation to provide support or technical assistance
                    directly to your end users or to you, and you shall not
                    represent to any of your end users that we are available to
                    provide such support.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    licensors' sole and exclusive property.

                    <br />
                    f) Downtime and Suspensions. Your access to and use of the
                    API or the Services may be interrupted for the duration of
                    any scheduled, unscheduled, or unanticipated downtime,
                    suspension or other unavailability, for any reason and in
                    our sole discretion, including but not limited to: (i) as a
                    result of power outages, system failures or other
                    interruptions, (ii) for scheduled and unscheduled downtime
                    to permit maintenance or modifications to the API or the
                    Services, (iii) in the event of a denial of service attack
                    or other attack or event that we determine may create any
                    risk to us, you or any of our users, customers, or
                    licensees, or (iv) in the event that we determine that any
                    Service is prohibited by applicable law or otherwise
                    determine that it is necessary or prudent to do so for legal
                    or regulatory reasons. We shall have no liability whatsoever
                    for any damage, liabilities, losses (including any loss of
                    data or profits) or any other consequences that you may
                    incur as a result of any downtime, suspension or other
                    unavailability of the API or the Services.

                    part of the Services at any time, with or without cause,
                    with or without notice, effective immediately, which may
                    result in the forfeiture and destruction of all information

                    Terms of Service which by their nature should survive
                    termination shall survive termination, including, without
                    limitation, licenses of User Content, ownership provisions,
                    warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of
                    liability.

                    DUTY TO TAKE ANY ACTION REGARDING: WHICH USERS GAIN ACCESS

                    intellectual property or other right of any person or

                    12. Governing Law and Jurisdiction. These Terms of Service
                    shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
                    laws of the State of New York, including its conflicts of
                    law rules, and the United States of America. You agree that
                    any dispute arising from or relating to the subject matter
                    of these Terms of Service shall be governed by the exclusive
                    jurisdiction and venue of the state and Federal courts of
                    New York County, New York.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    13. Modification. We reserve the right, in our sole
                    discretion, to modify or replace any of these Terms of
                    Service, or change, suspend, or discontinue the Services
                    (including without limitation, the availability of any
                    feature, database, or Content) at any time by posting
                    updates and/or changes to the Site (or the applicable
                    Services) or by sending you notice through the Services, via
                    e-mail or by another appropriate means of electronic
                    communication. We may also impose limits on certain features
                    and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the
                    Services without notice or liability. You shall be
                    responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any
                    such modifications, including by checking these Terms of
                    Service periodically for changes. Your continued use of the
                    Services following notification of any changes to these
                    Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    14. Miscellaneous. a) Force Majeure. We shall not be liable
                    for any failure to perform our obligations hereunder where
                    such failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable
                    control, including, without limitation, mechanical,
                    electronic or communications failure or degradation.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    b) Assignment. These Terms of Service are personal to you,
                    and are not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you
                    except with our prior written consent. We may assign,
                    transfer or delegate any of our rights and obligations
                    hereunder without consent.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    c) Agency. No agency, partnership, joint venture, or
                    employment relationship is created as a result of these
                    Terms of Service and neither party has any authority of any
                    kind to bind the other in any respect.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    d) Notices. Unless otherwise specified in these Term of
                    Service, all notices under these Terms of Service will be in
                    writing and will be deemed to have been duly given when
                    received, if personally delivered or sent by certified or
                    registered mail, return receipt requested; when receipt is
                    electronically confirmed, if transmitted by facsimile or
                    e-mail; or the day after it is sent, if sent for next day
                    delivery by recognized overnight delivery service.
                    Electronic notices should be sent to support@blerp.com.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    e) No Waiver. Our failure to enforce any part of these Terms
                    of Service shall not constitute a waiver of our right to
                    later enforce that or any other part of these Terms of
                    Service. Waiver of compliance in any particular instance
                    does not mean that we will waive compliance in the future.
                    In order for any waiver of compliance with these Terms of
                    Service to be binding, we must provide you with written
                    notice of such waiver through one of our authorized
                    representatives.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    f) Headings. The section and paragraph headings in these
                    Terms of Service are for convenience only and shall not
                    affect their interpretation.

                    information about you from various sources, including: (i)
                    your use of the Services generally; and (ii) from third
                    party websites and services. When you use the Services, you

                    What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This Privacy Policy covers the treatment of personally
                    identifiable information ("Personal Information") gathered
                    when you are using or accessing the Services. This Privacy
                    Policy also covers our treatment of any Personal Information
                    that our business partners share with us or that we share
                    with our business partners. This Privacy Policy does not
                    apply to the practices of third parties that we do not own
                    or control, including but not limited to any third party
                    websites, services and applications ("Third Party Services")
                    that you elect to access through the Service or to
                    individuals that we do not manage or employ. While we
                    attempt to facilitate access only to those Third Party
                    Services that share our respect for your privacy, we cannot
                    and do not take responsibility for the content or privacy
                    policies of those Third Party Services.

                    What Information Do We Collect?
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    The information we gather enables us to personalize, improve
                    and continue to operate the Services. In connection with
                    certain aspects of the Services, we may request, collect
                    and/or display some of your Personal Information. We collect
                    the following types of information from our users.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    Some features of the Services allow you to provide content
                    to the Services. All content submitted by you to the
                    Services may be retained by us indefinitely, even if and
                    after your access to the Services is terminated. We may
                    continue to disclose such content to third parties in a
                    manner that does not reveal Personal Information, as
                    described in this Privacy Policy.

                    We automatically receive and record information from your
                    web browser when you interact with the Services, including
                    your IP address and cookie information. This information is
                    used for fighting spam/malware and also to facilitate
                    collection of data concerning your interaction with the

                    usage information, such as the number and frequency of

                    We use cookies to enable our servers to recognize your web
                    browser and tell us how and when you visit the Site and
                    otherwise use the Services through the internet. Our cookies
                    do not, by themselves, contain Personal Information, and we
                    do not combine the general information collected through
                    cookies with other Personal Information to tell us who you
                    are. As noted, however, we do use cookies to identify that
                    your web browser has accessed aspects of the Services. You
                    can set your browser to not accept cookies, but this may
                    limit your ability to use the Services. This Privacy Policy
                    covers our use of cookies only and does not cover the use of
                    cookies by third parties. We do not control when or how
                    third parties place cookies on your computer.

                    Information Related to Advertising and the Use of Web

                    <br />
                    To support and enhance the Services, we may serve
                    advertisements, and also allow third parties advertisements,
                    through the Services. These advertisements are sometimes
                    targeted to particular users and may come from ad networks.
                    Advertisements served through the Services may be targeted
                    to users who fit a certain general profile category, which
                    may be based on anonymized information inferred from
                    information provided to us by a user, on the Services usage
                    patterns of particular users, or on your activity on Third
                    Party Services. We do not provide Personal Information to
                    any ad networks for use outside of the Services. To increase
                    the effectiveness of ad delivery, we may deliver a web
                    beacon from an ad network to you through the Services. Web
                    beacons allow ad networks to provide anonymized, aggregated
                    auditing, research and reporting for us and for advertisers.

                    The Services are designed to help you share information with
                    others. As a result, some of the information generated

                    Some of your activity on and through the Services is public
                    by default. This may include, but is not limited to, content
                    you have posted publicly on the Site or otherwise through
                    the Services. Information concerning your use of the
                    Services may be tracked anonymously through the use of
                    cookies and stored by us. If you choose to provide Personal
                    Information using certain public features of the Services,
                    then that information is governed by the privacy settings of

                    to other individuals or entities without our control and
                    without your knowledge, and search engines may index that
                    information. We therefore urge you to think carefully about
                    including any specific information you may deem private in
                    content that you create or information that you submit

                    We share this type of statistical data so that our partners
                    can understand how and how often people use our Services and

                    their services and how our Services interface with them. In
                    addition, these third parties may share with us non-private,

                    We employ and contract with people and other entities that
                    perform certain tasks on our behalf and who are under our
                    control (our "Agents"). We may need to share Personal
                    Information with our Agents in order to provide products or
                    services to you. Unless we tell you differently, our Agents
                    do not have any right to use Personal Information or other
                    information we share with them beyond what is necessary to

                    <br />
                    In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these
                    types of transactions, user information is typically one of
                    the transferred business assets. Moreover, if we, or
                    substantially all of our assets, were acquired, or if we go
                    out of business or enter bankruptcy, user information would
                    be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a
                    third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur,
                    and that any acquirer of us or our assets may continue to
                    use your Personal Information as set forth in this policy.

                    We also reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and

                    necessary to (i) satisfy any applicable law, regulation,
                    legal process or governmental request, (ii) enforce these
                    Terms of Service, including investigation of potential

                    exchanging information with other companies and
                    organizations for fraud protection and spam/malware
                    prevention.

                    all of our information, including your IP address
                    information, using industry-standard techniques. We do not
